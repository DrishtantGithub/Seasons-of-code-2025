# MNIST Digit Classifier

This is the second mini-project I completed as part of the **Seasons of Code 2025 **. The goal of this project is to build, train, and compare multiple deep learning models to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Project Overview

The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9), each of size 28x28 pixels. In this project, I:

- Performed data analysis and visualization (EDA)
- Explored dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE
- Built and trained three different neural architectures:
  - A fully connected **Neural Network (NN)**
  - A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
  - A **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** with GRU
- Evaluated each model using Accuracy, Loss, and ROC-AUC
- Plotted learning curves and confusion matrices
- Compared performance and summarized findings
